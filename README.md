# Cool-Compiler

This is our solution for the Stanford CS143 Compilers Course Project (also our ShanghaiTech CS131 Compilers Course Project).

The project contains 4 programming assignments. The first 2 assignments are completed by myself and the last 2 assignments are completed by a team of 2. Thanks my partner @sheyining's BIG help!

- PA1 - Lexical Analysis

- PA2 - Parsing
